# PowerBI-CMP3.1-PGLS-Dashboard
After UAT, the CMP3.1 PGLS Dashboard was created to monitor tickets during the Post Go-Live Support (PGLS) phase. This milestone ensured seamless PGLS initiation, with only one defect ticket reported post-Go-Live, highlighting the project's success and the dashboard's efficiency in managing ticket tracking and resolution.
